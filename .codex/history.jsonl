Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions render options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> | (add D/E as needed up to 5)\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) | (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate)\n\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options), output a single line after the question: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words)`.\n    - After the user answers:\n       * Validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       * If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       * Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       * All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       * User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       * You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       * Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       * Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       * Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       * User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       * Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       * Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       * Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       * Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/plan` or run `/clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n - If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n - If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: $ARGUMENTS\n"}

This command MUST run only after `/tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\nSTRICTLY READ-ONLY: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\nConstitution Authority: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/analyze`.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS.

Load artifacts:\n   - Parse spec.md sections: Overview/Context, Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, User Stories, Edge Cases (if present).\n   - Parse plan.md: Architecture/stack choices, Data Model references, Phases, Technical constraints.\n   - Parse tasks.md: Task IDs, descriptions, phase grouping, parallel markers [P], referenced file paths.\n   - Load constitution `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation.\n\n3. Build internal semantic models:\n   - Requirements inventory: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" -> `user-can-upload-file`).\n   - User story/action inventory.\n   - Task coverage mapping: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases).\n   - Constitution rule set: Extract principle names and any MUST/SHOULD normative statements.\n\n4. Detection passes:\n   A. Duplication detection:\n      - Identify near-duplicate requirements. Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation.\n   B. Ambiguity detection:\n      - Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria.\n      - Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, <placeholder>, etc.).\n   C. Underspecification:\n      - Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome.\n      - User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment.\n      - Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan.\n   D. Constitution alignment:\n      - Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle.\n      - Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution.\n   E. Coverage gaps:\n      - Requirements with zero associated tasks.\n      - Tasks with no mapped requirement/story.\n      - Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security).\n   F. Inconsistency:\n      - Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files).\n      - Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa).\n      - Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note).\n      - Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires to use Next.js while other says to use Vue as the framework).\n\n5. Severity assignment heuristic:\n   - CRITICAL: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality.\n   - HIGH: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion.\n   - MEDIUM: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case.\n   - LOW: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order.\n\n6. Produce a Markdown report (no file writes) with sections:\n\n   ### Specification Analysis Report\n   | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n   |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n   | A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n   (Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n   Additional subsections:\n   - Coverage Summary Table:\n     | Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n   - Constitution Alignment Issues (if any)\n   - Unmapped Tasks (if any)\n   - Metrics:\n     * Total Requirements\n     * Total Tasks\n     * Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n     * Ambiguity Count\n     * Duplication Count\n     * Critical Issues Count\n\n7.
